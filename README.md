# Customers Dashboard

A simple dashboard to manage and visualize customer data, built with React, Bootstrap, and Google Charts.

## Features

- **Dashboard Overview**: Display key statistics like total orders, total amount, and unique customers.
- **Search Functionality**: Search customers by name or phone number.
- **Order Details**: View details of individual customer orders.
- **Order Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of customer orders using a pie chart.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
- **Lodash**: JavaScript utility library for simplifying data manipulation.
- **Google Charts**: Used for visualizing data with charts.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests (included but not used).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Internet connection (to load external libraries like Bootstrap, React, Lodash, and Google Charts)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Csdivya1234/customers_dashboard_project.git
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:customers_dashboard_proj
    
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the dashboard.

### Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file that includes the project structure and references to external libraries.
- `js/raw.githubusercontent.com_lodash_lodash_4.17.15-npm_lodash.js`: Lodash library for utility functions.

### How It Works

1. **Customers Data**: The customer data is hardcoded within the script and is displayed in the dashboard.
2. **Statistics Section**: Provides an overview of total orders, total amount, and unique customers.
3. **Customer List & Search**: Displays a list of customers and allows filtering based on the search input.
4. **Order Details**: Clicking the "Show" button next to a customer displays all orders placed by that customer.
5. **Order Distribution**: Displays a pie chart showing the distribution of orders among customers.
